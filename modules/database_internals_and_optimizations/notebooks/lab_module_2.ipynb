    "- **The Hidden Cost (Postgres)**: Postgres runs as a separate Service (Client-Server). Even though it found the row instantly on disk, it had to package that data, send it over a TCP network port (to Python), and wait for Python to unpack it. That \"commute\" took 90% of the time.\n",
    "- **The In-Memory Advantage (DuckDB)**: DuckDB runs Embedded inside your Python process. It has zero network overhead. It grabs the data directly from RAM.\n",
    "- **The Physics is still true**: DuckDB did have to perform Tuple Reconstruction (stitching the Name, Email, and ID vectors back together), which is inefficient. However, the penalty for that was tiny compared to the \"Network Tax\" Postgres paid.\n",
